# Spooky Chat
Spooky Chat is a chat platform that is completely anonymous.
You don't have to provide an email address or any other information.
The chat platform is designed so that no data is stored and you always start from "zero" to guarantee full anonymity.
For this reason, all messages, as well as the user himself are deleted when logging out.
Google`s firestore realtime database is used for short time storage.

## Important
The chat is only used as a training project and is neither end to end encrypted nor otherwise secured.


## TODO

- Add Hash for additional authentification

- add End to End encryption

- increase performance (use e.g. React.memo and useCallback)

- remove redundancy / refactor code
